simpHTTP
  needs to accomodate any import
    create a config file with the file name and path
    do something similar to:
      ole.testset.py -> dT_pA_impModule()
    incorporate the .gitignore flag of adding tmp to the name 
      or create a new module specific flag
    check over hash if file changes while server is running
  
  needs to accomodate dot notation for args
  
  a way to write out
    will be much better than the current ['print all']->{copy}->{paste}->[save]
